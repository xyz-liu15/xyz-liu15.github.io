## 🌟 Personal Blog Dream in the AI Era

In today's rapidly advancing AI technology, have you ever imagined having your own digital space? Like planting a tree in the virtual world and watching it grow gradually. The progress of large language models has made this dream within reach - what once seemed like insurmountable technical barriers have now become accessible with AI assistance.

💡 **My Digital Garden Story**

As an ordinary person without technical background, I realized this dream with just 8.8 RMB domain fee. It's like buying a piece of digital land with the price of a cup of milk tea. Of course, the biggest investment was time - just like a gardener carefully nurturing beloved plants, I spent considerable time cultivating this blog. Every time I see the traffic grow, it feels like watching seeds I planted sprout and bloom.

## 🛠️ The Path of Technology Selection

### 🧩 Choosing Hugo Framework

To avoid reinventing the wheel, I chose **Hugo**, a static site generator. Like LEGO bricks, it provides abundant components and themes, allowing a "construction novice" like me to build beautiful digital cottages.

> Hugo's rapid build feature is like magic - regenerating the entire website in just seconds, reminding me of childhood building blocks where a gentle push could rebuild an entire castle.

### ✨ Highlights of FixIt Theme

Among many themes, FixIt ultimately won my heart for three reasons:

1. **🎨 Visual Aesthetics**: Like walking into a carefully designed café, FixIt's interface catches the eye at first glance. Especially its dark mode, resembling a warm desk lamp during late-night coding.
2. **🤖 Feature-Rich**: The built-in AI summary function acts like a thoughtful personal assistant, automatically extracting article highlights.
3. **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation serves as a thorough instruction manual, making the setup process enjoyable. When encountering issues, the documentation acts like a patient guide.

## ⚡ The Magic of Cloudflare

Cloudflare acts like my digital butler, providing comprehensive protection and support for the blog:

- 🚀 **CDN Acceleration**: Global access speed is lightning fast, like building highways on the internet.
- 🔒 **HTTPS Encryption**: Wearing bulletproof vests for data transmission, leaving hackers' prying eyes empty-handed.
- 🤖 **AI Summary Service**: Intelligent summaries implemented through work.js, like a tireless librarian.
- 🗄️ **KV Cache**: Efficiently storing frequently used data like a smart refrigerator, ready for immediate use without lag.
- 🌐 **Global Anycast Network**: No matter where visitors come from, they enjoy local-like access experience.

## 🤖 Magical Moments with Trae Assistant

The entire blog implementation is like a magic show, with Trae as the amazing magician. From project initialization to feature implementation, each step shines with AI's intelligent spark:

```bash
npx fixit-cli init my-blog  # A spell to open the digital garden
```

💫 **The Magical Experience of Code Generation**

From work.js to ai-summary.js, these codes seem to be automatically generated like magic. Trae not only provides code but also explains each line's function in detail, like a patient programming mentor:

> "This code is like installing an intelligent brain for the website, capable of automatically understanding article content and generating summaries."

Whenever encountering problems, Trae always offers three or more solutions, allowing a programming novice like me to make professional-level choices. Most magically, it can continuously optimize code based on my feedback, like an indefatigable pair programming partner.

## Non-Technical Choices
To avoid reinventing the wheel, I chose Hugo to build my personal blog. This framework offers many themes, and after careful consideration, I selected FixIt for the following reasons:
1. Beautiful webpage design with abundant showcase examples and comprehensive documentation
2. Integrated features I particularly like, such as AI-generated summaries

## Cloudflare as Digital Savior
I used Cloudflare for:
1. CDN acceleration
2. HTTPS encryption
3. Deploying work.js for AI summary backend
4. Using KV to cache AI summary content

## Trae
Code for work.js and ai-summary.js was written by AI agents in Trae.
In Trae, I used `npx fixit-cli` to initialize my personal blog.
