It aims to replace pip and virtualenv, offering faster dependency resolution and installation speeds. Below, I’ll provide a detailed guide on how to use uv. 1. Installing uv Installation Methods for Different Systems Windows On Windows, you can install using PowerShell: irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex This command downloads and executes the installation script, automatically adding uv to your system PATH. macOS/Linux On macOS or Linux, you can install using curl: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh After installation, you’ll need to reload your shell or run: source ~/.bashrc # or other shell configuration file Installing with pip (Alternative Method) pip install uv Verifying Installation After installation, run the following command to verify successful installation: uv --version 2. Configuring Mirrors in China Due to network constraints, users in China may experience slow connections to the official PyPI source. You can configure domestic mirrors to accelerate downloads. Temporary Mirror Usage You can specify a mirror directly in the command: uv pip install package-name --index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple Permanent Mirror Configuration Configure a global mirror (recommended): uv config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple Common domestic mirrors in China: Tsinghua University: https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple Alibaba Cloud: https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ Douban: https://pypi.douban.com/simple/ USTC: https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/ Viewing Current Configuration uv config list 3. Project Initialization Creating a New Project uv init my_project cd my_project This creates a Python project directory with a basic structure. Initializing an Existing Project In an existing project directory: uv init This creates necessary configuration files in the current directory. 4. Virtual Environment Configuration uv has built-in virtual environment management functionality that’s more efficient than traditional virtualenv. Creating a Virtual Environment uv venv .venv This creates a virtual environment directory named .venv in the current directory. Activating the Virtual Environment Activation methods for different systems: Windows (PowerShell): .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate Deactivating the Virtual Environment deactivate Why Use Virtual Environments? Virtual environments isolate dependencies between different projects, preventing package version conflicts. Each project can have its own independent Python environment and dependency packages. 5. Package Management Installing Packages uv pip install package-name Installing a specific version: uv pip install package-name==1.2.3 Installing development dependencies (typically used for testing, documentation tools, etc.): uv pip install --group=dev pytest Installing from requirements.txt uv pip install -r requirements.txt Generating requirements.txt uv pip freeze \u003e requirements.txt Upgrading Packages uv pip install --upgrade package-name Uninstalling Packages uv pip uninstall package-name Viewing Installed Packages uv pip list 6. Python Version Management uv can manage multiple Python versions, similar to pyenv. Installing a Specific Python Version uv toolchain install python@3.9.0 Listing Available Python Versions uv toolchain list Setting Project Python Version In the project directory: uv toolchain use python@3.9.0 This creates a .python-version file in the project directory, recording the Python version used. Why Manage Python Versions? Different projects may require different versions of the Python interpreter. Version management tools allow you to switch easily. 7. Advanced Features Parallel Installation uv uses parallel installation by default to accelerate the process: uv pip install -r requirements.txt -","date":"2025-05-03","objectID":"/en/posts/4b5bcb5/:0:0","tags":["Python","Tools","Tutorial"],"title":"Comprehensive Guide to Python's uv Library","uri":"/en/posts/4b5bcb5/"},{"categories":["Programming Technology"],"content":"A comprehensive guide to Miniconda, including installation, configuration, environment management, and mirror settings","date":"2025-05-03","objectID":"/en/posts/miniconda-tutorial/","tags":["Python","Development Tools"],"title":"Miniconda Tutorial","uri":"/en/posts/miniconda-tutorial/"},{"categories":["Programming Technology"],"content":"Miniconda Detailed Guide Table of Contents Introduction to Miniconda Installation and Configuration Windows macOS Linux Miniconda vs Anaconda Conda Mirror Configuration Python Virtual Environment Management Package Management and Dependency Control Advanced Techniques Environment Export and Sharing Dependency Conflict Resolution Environment Migration and Cross-platform Compatibility Miniconda and CI/CD Integration Common Issues and Debugging Conclusion 1. Introduction to Miniconda Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda, containing only the conda package management tool, Python, and a few core dependencies. It’s suitable for users who are sensitive to disk space or need customized environments, making it the preferred tool for managing Python virtual environments and scientific computing dependencies. 2. Installation and Configuration Windows Download the Installer https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html Select the Windows 64-bit version. Run the Installer Check Add Miniconda to PATH (requires administrator privileges). Restart the terminal after installation. Verify Installation conda --version macOS Download the Installer Choose macOS 64-bit (bash) or Apple Silicon (M1/M2) version. Terminal Installation bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh Configure PATH Edit ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile, add: export PATH=\"/opt/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\" Linux Download the Installation Script wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh Execute Installation bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh Activate Environment source ~/.bashrc 3. Miniconda vs Anaconda Feature Miniconda Anaconda Installation Size ~100 MB ~3 GB Pre-installed Packages Core tools only 1500+ scientific computing packages Use Cases Custom environments, lightweight deployment Ready-to-use, rapid prototype development Flexibility High (install as needed) Low (pre-installed packages) 4.
